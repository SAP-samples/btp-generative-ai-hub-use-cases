    "## 4. Document Grounding (Workaround)\n",
    "\n",
    "As of Nov 2024, the document grounding has not been exposed via the SDKs, thus this is a workaround to call the API directly via the /completion endpoint.\n",
    "While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding and generating human-like text, they often lack the specificity and context of business data. To unleash the potential for LLMs, in particular, in conversational use cases, providing the right context to ground LLMs in business reality is essential to make the generated answers relevant (factually correct), reliable (based on up-to-date information), and responsible (trace factual errors to the corresponding data source). We use the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique to optimize the output of a large language model with information that is use-case-specific and not available as a training data source for LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI-assisted document grounding lets SAP customers use their own specific unstructured or semi-structured documents to provide answers to user questions. Customers can connect their document repositories via a Microsoft SharePoint site.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick check on Document Grounding Support\n",
    "\n",
    "- Grounding is supported by up to 2,000 documents\n",

    "- Document Content: Plain Text (tables and images are not supported)\n",
