            <h2>Giving notice of marriage or civil partnership</h2>
            <p class="well">By law you must give notice of a marriage or civil partnership. This is a formal declaration
                of your intention to enter into civil partnership or marriage. You are both required to give notice and
                there is a <a
                    href="https://www.sagenaicity.gov.uk/info/876/civil_partnerships/2968/marriage_and_civil_partnership_ceremonies/4">standard
                    fee</a> for this.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you live in Sagenai, you must give notice to us at the Sagenai Registration Service. If either
                or both of you live in another district, then you must give your notice(s) at your local register
                office(s) unless advised otherwise for example, if either of you is a non-European Economic Area
                National - <a
                    href="https://www.sagenaicity.gov.uk/info/200067/marriages_and_civil_partnerships/644/organise_a_marriage/2">see
                    information for non-EEA Nationals</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Prior to giving notice you must have lived in the district where you are giving notice for a minimum of 7
                full days.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Your marriage or civil partnership can only be formed at the venue you name on the formal notice, so you
                need to have chosen your venue before you give notice. If you change the venue you will have to give,
                and pay for, fresh notices. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Marriages and Civil Partnership are available for both same sex and opposite sex couples. It is not
                currently possible to convert a marriage to a civil partnership. <a
                    href="https://www.sagenaicity.gov.uk/info/200067/marriages_and_civil_partnerships/644/organise_a_marriage/5">Read
                    about the differences between a marriage and a civil partnership</a></p>

            <p><a

                    out more about the ceremonies and venues available in Sagenai</a></p>

            <h3>Make an appointment to give notice&nbsp;</h3>

            <p>If you live within the Sagenai registration district you can now make an appointment
                online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Timings are important: you cannot give notice of a civil partnership or marriage more than a year before
                the date of the ceremony, and a marriage or civil partnership cannot be formed until <strong>a minimum
                    of 28 full days</strong> after you have given the notice.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Couples wanting to marry in the Church of England or Church in Wales, where one or both are non-EEA
                national(s), must give their notice of marriage at their local Register Office.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You do not need an account log-on. You will be booking your appointment as a guest on the system.</p>

            <p><a href="http://sagenaicity.zipporah.co.uk/CeremonyPlanner/">Book an appointment to give notice</a></p>

            <p>If you arrive for a notice appointment and do not have <a
                    href="https://www.sagenaicity.gov.uk/info/200067/marriages_and_civil_partnerships/644/organise_a_marriage/3">the
                    required documentation</a>, or do not meet the residency requirements, then the notice appointment
                will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;be able to go ahead. A further appointment will need to be made, and
                the fees will need to be paid again. If you are in any doubt please contact the Register Office
                at:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:registeroffice@sagenaicity.gov.uk">registeroffice@sagenaicity.gov.uk</a>&nbsp; If
                you would like to speak to a member of staff, please include a daytime telephone number in your email.
