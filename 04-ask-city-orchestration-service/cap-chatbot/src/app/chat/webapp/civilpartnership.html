            <h2>Ceremonies at the register office</h2>
            <p>Before you can get married or enter a civil partnership you must give a formal notice. <a
                    href="https://www.sagenaicity.gov.uk/info/200067/marriages_and_civil_partnerships/644/organise_a_marriage">Find
                    out what you need to book an appointment to give notice</a>.</p>

            <p>Ceremonies at the Sagenai Register Office are held in the Pankhurst Suite, Heron House, 47 Lloyd
                Street, Sagenai, M2 5LE.&nbsp; Telephone number 0161-234-5005.</p>

            <p>There is a large <a href="https://www.sagenaicity.gov.uk/galleries/gallery/4/register_office"
                    title="Pankhurst Suite">ceremony room</a> at the Pankhurst Suite (the maximum capacity of the room
                is 70 people, the couple, 2 witnesses and up to 66 guests), a large waiting area for guests and a
                small&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sagenaicity.gov.uk/galleries/gallery/4/register_office"
                    title="Private waiting room">private waiting room</a> for the couple to use. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Two witnesses are needed: they can be anybody, including family members, but must both be over the age of
                16, speak English and understand what is taking place. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>For a basic ceremony, with just two witnesses and no guests, there are times that the Pankhurst Suite can
                be booked at a lower fee, but availability is limited. See Standard Ceremony fees information. &nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>The Pankhurst Suite is very popular as a marriage venue, particularly in the summer, so we allow
                provisional bookings up to two years in advance. To book your ceremony in the Pankhurst Suite, email us
                at: registeroffice@sagenaicity.gov.uk with details of your enquiry and a daytime phone number. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>A non-refundable deposit of Â£40 is payable when you book. &nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Marriage&nbsp;</h3>

            <p>You can get married in any approved venue in England and Wales as long as itâ€™s been licensed by the local
                authority. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>The marriage can only take place at the venue you name on the notice of marriage. If you change the venue
                you will need to give, and pay for, an updated notice of marriage. &nbsp;</p>

            <p><a
                    href="/info/200067/marriages_and_civil_partnerships/3724/venues_available_for_your_wedding_or_civil_partnership">See
                    a list of licensed venues in Sagenai</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you want to marry in a licensed venue youâ€™ll need to book a registrar to attend. Bookings can be made
                up to two years in advance but weâ€™d advise you to check that a registrar is available before confirming
                your venue booking. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>To book a registrar email us at: <a
                    href="mailto:registeroffice@sagenaicity.gov.uk">registeroffice@sagenaicity.gov.uk</a> with a daytime
                phone number we can call you back on. A non-refundable deposit of Â£40 is payable when you book. &nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>Two witnesses are needed. They can be anybody, including family members, but they must both be over the
                age of 16, speak English and understand what is taking place. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>On the day of your ceremony you will sign a Marriage Schedule: itâ€™s a one-page document&nbsp;thatâ€™s
                needed to register your marriage. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Your Marriage Schedule will include the details of each person getting married: name and surname, date of
                birth, condition, address and occupation. You can record your mother, father, parentsâ€™ or step-parent's
                details on this document and in the marriage registration. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;If your ceremony is not taking place at a Religious Building, the Superintendent Registrar will
                keep the schedule until the day of the ceremony. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you are marrying in a religious building, you must arrange for the Marriage Schedule to be collected
                in advance, and taken to the person who will perform the marriage at the religious building before your
                ceremony. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you are marrying in the Church of England/Church in Wales you will need to contact the Church in the
                parish where you intend to marry. &nbsp;</p>

            <h4>After the ceremony &nbsp;</h4>

            <p><strong>Civil ceremonies</strong>: the registration officer will keep the signed Marriage Schedule and
                add the details onto the electronic register at the register office, at the earliest opportunity. The
                certificate will be available to collect the following working day, if you require the certificate to be
                posted to you please request this on the day of the ceremony.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Religious ceremonies</strong>: the relevant person from the religious building will return the
                completed, signed Marriage Schedule to the register office in the district where your marriage took
                place within 21 days of your marriage. Once itâ€™s received at the register office the details will be
                entered onto the electronic marriage register within 7 days; only then will a marriage certificate be
                available. &nbsp;You should then make an application on-line for your certificate.&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Civil Partnership&nbsp;</h3>

            <p>A civil partnership is formed once the couple have signed the Civil Partnership Schedule in the presence
                of two witnesses and the Civil Partnership registrar. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>The registration of a civil partnership has a simple format. If you prefer, you can opt to simply sign
                the schedule, without a ceremony, in the presence of your witnesses and a civil partnership registrar.
                &nbsp;</p>

            <p>The civil partnership schedule will contain a form of words that you must both acknowledge when you sign
                it, and which you can say to each other as part of a civil partnership formation if you like. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Although a ceremony is not part of the legal requirement, if you do want one Sagenai Register Office
                provides a range of options in which the legal signing will be included. We can design a ceremony to
                meet your individual needs.</p>

            <p>A civil partnership can only be formed at the venue you name on your notice of civil partnership. If you
                change the venue youâ€™d have to give, and pay for&nbsp;fresh notices of civil partnership.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you want to hold your civil partnership in a licensed venue you will need to book a registrar. This
                can be done up to two years in advance Always check that a registrar is available before confirming your
                venue.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You can hold your ceremony in any approved venue in England and Wales: a wide range of approved venues
                are available in Sagenai. &nbsp;<a
                    href="/info/200067/marriages_and_civil_partnerships/3724/venues_available_for_your_wedding_or_civil_partnership">See
                    a list of licensed venues in Sagenai</a>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You can also hold a civil partnership ceremony in religious premises, as long as the premises have
                applied for, and been given, approval to hold civil partnership ceremonies. This will still be a civil
                ceremony, not a religious one.&nbsp;There are no&nbsp;religious premises&nbsp;in Sagenai currently
                approved to hold civil partnership ceremonies.</p>
