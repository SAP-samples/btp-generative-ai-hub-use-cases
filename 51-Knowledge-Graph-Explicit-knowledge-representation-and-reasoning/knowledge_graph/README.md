# Custom support team knowledge graph
Here you find the triples defining the ontology of the customer support team knowledge graph and some facts (expressed also as triples) generated by the team activity and coming from the CRM relational data model.

All the files are provided in Turtle serialization and needs to be loaded into the HANA Cloud Knowledge Graph Engine.

# Upload triples to the HANA Cloud Knowledge Graph Engine

Files need to be in Turtle serialization to be uploaded. One approach is to use the python interface and load the files one by one. It is possible to load all the triples into one graph or more than one. Please, refer to the [relative Jupyter notebook](./notebooks/load_triples_to_kge.ipynb).
